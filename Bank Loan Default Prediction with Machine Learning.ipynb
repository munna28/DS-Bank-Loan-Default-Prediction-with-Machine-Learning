    "Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set."

    "# What is hypothesis generation?\n",
    "Essentially, the terms \"classifier\" and \"model\" are synonymous in certain contexts; however, sometimes people refer to \"classifier\" as the learning algorithm that learns the model from the training data. To makes things more tractable, let's define some of the key terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training sample: \n",
    "A training sample is a data point x in an available training set that we use for tackling a predictive modeling task. For example, if we are interested in classifying emails, one email in our dataset would be one training sample. Sometimes, people also use the synonymous terms training instance or training example.\n",
    "* Target function: \n",
    "In predictive modeling, we are typically interested in modeling a particular process; we want to learn or approximate a particular function that, for example, let's us distinguish spam from non-spam email. The target function f(x) = y is the true function f that we want to model.\n",
    "* Hypothesis: \n",
    "A hypothesis is a certain function that we believe (or hope) is similar to the true function, the target function that we want to model. In context of email spam classification, it would be the rule we came up with that allows us to separate spam from non-spam emails.\n",
    "* Model: \n",
    "In machine learning field, the terms hypothesis and model are often used interchangeably. In other sciences, they can have different meanings, i.e., the hypothesis would be the \"educated guess\" by the scientist, and the model would be the manifestation of this guess that can be used to test the hypothesis.\n",
    "* Learning algorithm: \n",
    "Again, our goal is to find or approximate the target function, and the learning algorithm is a set of instructions that tries to model the target function using our training dataset. A learning algorithm comes with a hypothesis space, the set of possible hypotheses it can come up with in order to model the unknown target function by formulating the final hypothesis\n",
    "* Classifier: \n",
    "A classifier is a special case of a hypothesis (nowadays, often learned by a machine learning algorithm). A classifier is a hypothesis or discrete-valued function that is used to assign (categorical) class labels to particular data points. In the email classification example, this classifier could be a hypothesis for labeling emails as spam or non-spam. However, a hypothesis must not necessarily be synonymous to a classifier. In a different application, our hypothesis could be a function for mapping study time and educational backgrounds of students to their future SAT scores.\n",
    "* So, we can say that a classifier is a special case of a hypothesis or model: a classifier is a function that assigns a class label to a data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis Generation is  very important stage in any data science/machine learning pipeline. It involves understanding the problem in detail by brainstorming as many factors as possible which can impact the outcome. It is done by understanding the problem statement thoroughly and before looking at the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some of the factors which I think can affect the Loan Approval (dependent variable for this loan prediction problem):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Salary: Applicants with high income should have more chances of loan approval.\n",
    "- Previous history: Applicants who have repayed their previous debts should have higher chances of loan approval.\n",
    "- Loan amount: Loan approval should also depend on the loan amount. If the loan amount is less, chances of loan approval should be high.\n",
    "- Loan term: Loan for less time period and less amount should have higher chances of approval.\n",
    "- EMI: Lesser the amount to be paid monthly to repay the loan, higher the chances of loan approval."

    "- Test file contains all the independent variables, but not the target variable. We will apply the model to predict the target variable for the test data.\n",
    "- Sample submission file contains the format in which we have to submit our predictions."
